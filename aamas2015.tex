\begin{abstract}
In this, paper we introduce an efficient representation for robot grasping that exploits symmetry
properties of objects. The new representation forms a low-dimensional manifold, which can be used to
identify the set of feasible grasps during a sequential manipulation task. We analyse the properties
of this low-dimensional manifold and show that some of these properties can be used for fast
manipulation planning. We apply the introduced representation and planner to bi-manual manipulation
in humanoid robots.
